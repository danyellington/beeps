This application is a website that gathers numerical input from a user and returns "beep" or "boop" in place
of any zeroes or ones. If the user inputs a number that is divisible by three, the program returns the result:
"I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."


## Specifications

The program recognizes numbers

It can count up to the provided numbers
  (ex: input: 2 output: 1,2)

The program identifies numbers divisible by three

The program divides divisible numbers by three

Any numbers divisible by three = "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."
  (ex: input: 30 output: "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.")

identifies "0" in a number not divisible by three and replaces number with word "beep"
  (ex: input: 320 output: "beep")

identifies "1" in a number not divisible by three and replaces number with word "boop"
  (ex: input: 341 output: "boop")

identifies numbers not divisible by three with both "0" and "1"

Numbers not divisible by three containing both ones and zeroes in any quantity and order = "beep boop"
  (ex: input: 51,001 output: "beep boop")
